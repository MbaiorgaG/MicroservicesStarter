= Customization & Extension Guide

The following guides will help you work with and develop extensions on top of the
backend APIs and microservices framework provided with Broadleaf.

They are a great way to experience some core fundamentals before diving into more complex scenarios.

[TIP]
====
We recommend following along with this guide in the order in which it is presented. Each section
may build on and reference extensions created in a previous section

== Service Anatomy Overview

Before we begin, it's best to understand the general anatomy of every Broadleaf microservice.
The diagram below provides a good high level overview depicting the different layers that a request
can go through as it flows through a particular service. The key takeaway is that that every layer
in the architecture can be customized and extended to fit unique business needs and requirements.
In these tutorials, we'll be walking you through typical customizations paths that touch some
of these different layers.

== Putting It All Together

Now that we have all the customizations and extensions in place, let's go ahead and re-build
our application and re-start our backend services.

With the customizations above, we should:

- see our new simple property field on `Product` be manageable in the Admin
- whenever a new `Product` is created through the admin, you should see some
information logging in your console that was added in Step 4
- when you create a new `Product` and create a new `Export` job, the resulting CSV should also
contain a new header and column with the appropriate extended field
